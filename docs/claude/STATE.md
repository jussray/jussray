## 2026-10-05

- Private product repo PR #1 merged to main (`6be1804`) at exact green head `4c1732b` on Juss's approval.

### chief-ai-machine — Chief edge defense regression
- VERIFIED: #141 reconcile merge `07e2d31` (2026-10-04) reverted `wrangler.jsonc`: Worker main `security/chief-edge-entry.js` → `worker/index.js`, `CHIEF_RATE_LIMITER` binding removed, `/api` `/github` dropped from `run_worker_first`. Reciprocal Defense Contract red on main since (runs #27, #28).
- VERIFIED: fix = PR #205 `security/restore-chief-edge-wiring` @ `e19b9fc` (byte-identical restore + test + 2 lint fixes). Local: lint clean, 687 tests, Playwright witness fails on main / passes on head.
- VERIFIED: Reciprocal Defense Contract **green** on `e19b9fc` (run 37352429735, manual dispatch — the push never triggered it), incl. Playwright witness through wrangler. Workers Builds preview deploy of `e19b9fc` succeeded.
- BLOCKED, not merged (`mergeable_state: blocked`). 6 red checks, none a defect in the PR diff:
  - red on main too @ `ba81a9b`: Operational Proof Contract (video-renderer workflows lack superseded-run cancellation), Quality Gate Typecheck (`node:*` types in `src/domain/video-renderer.js`), Test Ledger (rollup).
  - Governance Boundary: workflow bug — on `pull_request`, `GITHUB_SHA` (merge ref) ≠ `RELEASE_SHA` (head) → bake script refuses. One-line fix proposed on PR (`env -u GITHUB_SHA`); applying it was refused by the session's CI-bypass guard → needs Juss.
  - ProofMode MCP Playwright + Required Check Materializer: preview proof 302 → Cloudflare Access. Founder decision on Access for previews.
- OPEN findings (not fixed): decoy unreachable for `/.env`-style paths (asset fallback answers first); defense check not a required status check; full-attack-unit checks partly constant; Node path trusts `x-forwarded-for`; policy vs binding limit mismatch.
- DISPROVEN (earlier claim, now invalidated): "`.assetsignore` misses scripts/, test/, e2e/, config/, tools/, .security/" — those are excluded (lines 47–80); real Worker returns the SPA fallback for them. The earlier claim came from reading only the first 60 lines.
- VERIFIED + fixed: `supabase/` was NOT excluded — `/supabase/migrations/*.sql` (7 files) served publicly (`200 application/sql`, exact bytes). Fix PR #206 `security/assetsignore-supabase` @ `6e7c82d`: boundary test fails→passes, 687 tests, Chromium real path shows SPA fallback, no SQL. Production UNKNOWN until deploy.
- Stale branch `fix/restore-chief-edge-wiring` left on origin (proxy refused delete) — same commit, safe to delete.

### jussray — worlds-patch-executor
- VERIFIED gap: a patch can be READY while an upstream world's own required check is failing (only queued upstream patches were considered). Fix on branch `docs/claude-founder-working-rules`.

### Other-model input (Perplexity, 2026-10-05) — verified, mostly rejected
- release-evidence script: needs `BUILD_ID`/`DEPLOY_ENV`, set by no workflow in chief/jussray/FCR → would fail every build. Rejected (chief already binds exact-head receipts).
- dependency gate: calls `lint`/`typecheck` everywhere; jussray has no package.json, Protect Me has neither script → breaks those CIs. Rejected; existing per-repo CI covers it.
- artifact leak scan: idea adopted, script rejected — `find -type f -name .git` can't match a `.git` directory (fake green, VERIFIED), and its secret grep prints matches into logs. Applied correctly as real-artifact probes → found the supabase leak above.
- Its repo descriptions (Sekret-Bip RN/Expo, FCR, StoryEngine, JBH Shopify) are from public pages only — INFERRED, not checked against source.

### Decisions
- Founder working rules recorded in `CLAUDE.md` (this branch).
- ultrathink-devil: not a new skill (≈70% duplicates ULTRATHINK- `reasoning-stack` Redteam/Lindy twins + juss-os law 1). Unique parts (consequence classes, planes, adaptive budget, ≤3 options) are being made executable in the private product repo. Pasted source was truncated after "Can a mode or untrusted" — remainder UNKNOWN.
- Drift to resolve (founder decision): two juss-os versions exist — installed skill (79-line kernel, v3-DRAFT) vs `ULTRATHINK-` repo (110-line kernel). Neither recorded as FOUNDER ACCEPT.
